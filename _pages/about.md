## About
Hello! I am a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at CU Boulder studying computer vision. My main interests lie in computational photography, vision + language, and few-shot/representation learning. I am fortunate to be supported by the NSF through a GRFP Fellowship and am advised by [Dr. Danna Gurari](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/AboutMe.html). In the past I have interned at [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/)  for Natural Language Processing under [Dr. Karl Pazdernik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-pazdernik-1283b392/) and spent my undergrad studying computer vision under [Dr. Scott Wehrwein](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~wehrwes/) and Bioinformatics under [Dr. Filip Jagodzinski](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~jagodzf/). In my free time I love trail running, skiing, sufferfesting, cooking, and just generally being outside!

## Grad Application Help
Grad application season is tough and I would be happy to chat with anyone thinking of applying to Ph.D. programs! I can help review materials, share my own materials, or just answer general grad school questions. As a first generation college student I know there are a lot of unspoken rules out there and I would be happy to help anyone navigate them! 

## GRFP Help
The GRFP has afforded me many opportunities so far so I encourage anyone who is elligible to apply! I am happy to chat abou the application process and have made my research statement available on this website. I am also happy to share my reviews and personal statement upon request.

## Updates
- 3/01/2022: I'll be joining [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) this summer to work on computational photography problems with [Brian Price](https://www.brianpricephd.com/)!
- 2/24/2022: Gave a talk at [The Teen Science Cafe](https://teensciencecafe.org/cafes/science-discovery-teen-cafe/) about my research, my path to becoming a graduate student, and accessibility!
