## About
Hello! I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at CU Boulder studying computer vision. My main interests lie in computational photography, vision and language, and human centered computing. I am fortunate to be supported by the NSF through a GRFP Fellowship and am advised by [Dr. Danna Gurari](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/AboutMe.html). In the past I have interned at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) for interactive segmentation under [Dr. Brian Price](https://www.brianpricephd.com/) and Dr. Yifei Fan, [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/) for Natural/Spoken Language Processing under [Dr. Karl Pazdernik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-pazdernik-1283b392/) and spent my undergrad studying Computer Vision under [Dr. Scott Wehrwein](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~wehrwes/) and Bioinformatics under [Dr. Filip Jagodzinski](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~jagodzf/). In a prior life I worked on VR/AR applications at PNNL and accessible web applications at WWU. In my free time I love photography, [trail running](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Josh&lname=Myers-Dean), skiing, sufferfesting, cooking, and just generally being outside!


## Outreach
I am looking to get involved in low income/underrepresented high schools in the Front Range for CS education - let's chat! Fall semester of 2022 I will be involved with the [ITLP](https://itll.colorado.edu/)! Stayed tuned for our curriculum! 

## Grad Application Help
Grad application season is tough and I would be happy to chat with anyone thinking of applying to Ph.D. programs! I can help review materials, share my own materials, or just answer general grad school questions. As a first generation college student I know there are a lot of unspoken rules out there and I would be happy to help anyone navigate them! While it is not perfect, CU Boulder does offer an [admission fee waiver](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/admissions/graduate-students/graduate-application-fee-waiver) for those who are elligible.

## GRFP Help
The GRFP has afforded me many opportunities so far so I encourage anyone who is elligible to apply! I am happy to chat about the application process and have made my research statement available on this website. I am also happy to share my reviews and personal statement upon request.
