Hello! I am a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at CU Boulder studying Computer Vision. My main interests lie in Computational Photography, few-shot learning, and the broader impacts of Computer Vision. I am fortunate to be supported through the NSF through a GRFP Fellowship and am advised by [Dr. Danna Gurari](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/AboutMe.html). In the past I have interned at [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/)  for Natural Language Processing under [Dr. Karl Pazdernik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-pazdernik-1283b392/) and spent my undergrad studying Computer Vision under [Dr. Scott Wehrwein](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~wehrwes/) and Bioinformatics under [Dr. Filip Jagodzinski](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~jagodzf/). In my free time I love trail running, skiing, sufferfesting, cooking, and just generally being outside!
