## About
I am a second-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in computer vision. My research interests include (few-shot, interactive, part) segmentation, and image captioning. More broadly, I am excited about Computer Vision as a whole. I am grateful to be supported by the National Science Foundation through a GRFP Fellowship, and I am advised by [Dr. Danna Gurari](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/AboutMe.html).

In the past, I have had the opportunity to intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), where I worked on interactive segmentation under [Dr. Brian Price](https://www.brianpricephd.com/) and Dr. Yifei Fan, as well as at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/)), where I focused on natural/spoken language processing under [Dr. Karl Pazdernik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-pazdernik-1283b392/) and VR/AR applications. My undergraduate research at Western Washington University ([WWU](https://cs.wwu.edu/)) included Computer Vision with [Dr. Scott Wehrwein](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~wehrwes/), Bioinformatics with [Dr. Filip Jagodzinski](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~jagodzf/), and Computer Science Education with [Dr. Qiang Hao](https://qhao.info/). While at WWU I worked as a web developer to make websites more accessible. 

In my free time I love photography, knitting, [trail running](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Josh&lname=Myers-Dean), skiing, biking, cooking, and just generally being outside!


## Outreach
I am involved with the [ITLL](https://itll.colorado.edu/) at CU Boulder and the [I Have a Dream Foundation](https://bouldercounty.ihdf.org/programs/current-classes/diagonal-class/) in North Boulder where I help design tinkering activities using [micro:bits](https://microbit.org/) to engage middle school students in computing!

## Grad Application Help
Grad application season is tough and I would be happy to chat with anyone thinking of applying to Ph.D. programs! I can help review materials, share my own materials, or just answer general grad school questions. As a first generation college student I know there are a lot of unspoken rules out there and I would be happy to help anyone navigate them! While it is not perfect, CU Boulder does offer an [admission fee waiver](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/admissions/graduate-students/graduate-application-fee-waiver) for those who are elligible.

## GRFP Help
The GRFP has afforded me many opportunities so far so I encourage anyone who is elligible to apply! I am happy to chat about the application process and have made my research statement available on this website. I am also happy to share my reviews and personal statement upon request.

## Updates
- 4/7/2023: I received a best "Work In Progress" award (4 winners) for our work on interactive segmentation from our department's [annual research expo](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/2023/02/28/computer-science-graduate-research-expo) as well as a [departmental service award](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/news-events/student-awards#outstanding_service-939)!
- 1/13/2023: I'll be joining the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) on the [PRIOR](https://prior.allenai.org/) team with [Favyen Bastani](https://favyen.com/) this summer! Excited to be back in Seattle!
- 11/30/2022: Finished up a great semester of outreach with the [ITLP](https://itll.colorado.edu/)! Keep an eye out for our series of micro:bit activities.
