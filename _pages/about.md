## About
I am a third-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research interests include (semantic, interactive, part) segmentation, few-shot learning, and image captioning. I am grateful to be supported by the National Science Foundation through a GRFP Fellowship, and I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Danna Gurari](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/AboutMe.html). I also frequently collaborate with the wonderful folks at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/).

In the past, I have had the opportunity to intern at [The Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) with [Dr. Favyen Bastani](https://favyen.com/) and [Dr. Aniruddha Kembhavi](https://anikem.github.io/), working on unsupervised learning for remote sensing time series change detection. I have also spent time at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), where I worked on interactive segmentation with [Dr. Brian Price](https://www.brianpricephd.com/) and Dr. Yifei Fan, as well as at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/)), where I worked on natural/spoken language processing problems and VR applications with [Dr. Karl Pazdernik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-pazdernik-1283b392/). My undergraduate research at Western Washington University ([WWU](https://cs.wwu.edu/)) included Computational Photography and Geospatial Computer Vision with [Dr. Scott Wehrwein](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~wehrwes/), Structural Bioinformatics with [Dr. Filip Jagodzinski](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~jagodzf/), and Computer Science Education with [Dr. Qiang Hao](https://qhao.info/). While at WWU I worked as a web developer to make websites more accessible. 

In my free time I love photography, knitting, [trail running](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Josh&lname=Myers-Dean), skiing, biking, cooking, and just generally being outside!


## Outreach
I am involved with the [ITLL](https://itll.colorado.edu/) at CU Boulder and the [I Have a Dream Foundation](https://bouldercounty.ihdf.org/programs/current-classes/diagonal-class/) in North Boulder where I help design tinkering activities using [micro:bits](https://microbit.org/) to engage middle school students in computing! Please get in touch if you'd like to collaborate on outreach projects.

## Grad Application Help
Grad application season is tough and I would be happy to chat with anyone thinking of applying to Ph.D. programs! I can help review materials, share my own materials, or just answer general grad school questions. As a first generation college student I know there are a lot of unspoken rules out there and I would be happy to help anyone navigate them! While it is not perfect, CU Boulder does offer an [admission fee waiver](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/admissions/graduate-students/graduate-application-fee-waiver) for those who are elligible.

## GRFP Help
The GRFP has afforded me many opportunities so far so I encourage anyone who is elligible to apply! I am happy to chat about the application process and have made my research statement available on this website. I am also happy to share my reviews and personal statement upon request.

## Updates
